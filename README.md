# Chords
A WordPress plug-in. Add chords using shortcodes!   
**The chords will be shown exactly where you want on all devices regardless of the font!**

## Usage:
`[showHide]Click me[showHide]` display a button to show or hide chords.  
`[chords]...[/chords]` delimit the lyrics of the song to which you want to put chords.  
`[A]` is a chord, you must put it just before the letter you want it to be placed on.

### Let's do an example:
```
[showHide]Click-me to hide chords![showHide]

[chords]
Here you can insert the text of your song with chords like:
[A]Lorem ip[E7]sum...
When publish the chords will appear above the letter you put before
[/chords]
```

#### Result:
```
Here you can insert the text of your song with chords like:
A       E7
Lorem ipsum...
When publish the chords will appear above the letter you put before
```
